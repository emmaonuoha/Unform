# UNFORM

**Build something real. Every day.**

Unform is a daily execution platform for builders.  
Every day, Unform delivers one **buildable idea** paired with **AI-guided execution prompts** to help anyone turn thoughts into shipped artifacts.

This is not an idea list.  
This is an execution engine.

---

## WHAT IS UNFORM?

Most people don’t struggle with ideas.  
They struggle with **what to build next** and **how to start**.

Unform exists to remove that friction.

Every day, Unform provides:
- A clear, constrained, buildable idea
- Structured AI prompts to execute it
- Simple shipping criteria to define “done”

The goal is momentum — not perfection.

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

Unform is built on a few core beliefs:

- **Ideas are abundant. Execution is rare.**
- **Shipping small beats planning big.**
- **Constraints create momentum.**
- **Builders don’t need motivation — they need a starting point.**

Unform is opinionated by design.  
It prioritizes output over discussion.

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Get today’s idea**  
   One focused, buildable idea designed to be shipped in 24–72 hours.

2. **Follow the Unform prompts**  
   AI-powered prompts guide you from idea → prototype → artifact.

3. **Ship something real**  
   A landing page, MVP, script, demo, or prototype counts.

4. **Repeat daily**  
   Momentum compounds.

## WHAT COUNTS AS “Shipping”?

Shipping does **not** mean perfection.

Shipping can be:
- A landing page
- A prototype or demo
- A working script or bot
- A Notion doc or system
- A deployed MVP
- A public proof-of-work

If it exists and can be shared, it ships.
